What did the pilot report on the accident no. CEN19FA018?,"The pilot was on a scheduled pipeline patrol observation flight in a turboshaft-powered helicopter. When the pilot did not arrive at his destination, an alert notice was issued for the overdue helicopter. The helicopter wreckage was located about 22 miles west of the helicopter's departure point in a remote wooded area that was about 200 yards north of the east-west pipeline. The pilot was not in contact with air traffic control during the flight, and there was no record of a distress call. A witness working on the pipeline about 2 to 3 miles from the accident site, reported seeing the helicopter fly overhead and further reported that the helicopter looked and sounded ""normal.""   Visual meteorological conditions surrounded the area of the accident with 10 miles visibility and an overcast sky at 1,600 ft.  The post-crash fire consumed most of the cabin area, which limited the scope of the airframe and engine examinations. Additionally, fire damage prevented the retrieval of information from the helicopter's cockpit image and flight data monitoring system, including nonvolatile memory from the digital engine control unit and engine data recorder. However, no preimpact abnormalities were noted during the engine or airframe examinations. Further, the engine's intake axial compressor blades exhibited damage near the outer tips, and the module 5 torque nut had a slippage of about 1/16 to 1/8 inch, (2 to 4 millimeters) consistent with the engine producing power at the time of impact.   The pilot's autopsy noted moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease, scarring of the heart muscle from a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), and changes in the blood vessels of the liver that were indicative of congestive heart failure. Thus, the pilot would have been at an increased risk for an acute coronary event causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or fainting. The pilot's complete medical history was not available, and a determination of medical impairment or incapacitation could not be made based on the available evidence for the accident.","The pilot reported that he was uneventfully after a local flight, the airplane continued touchdown, the airplane touched down, he had failed to the right. The airplane was unable to the left and the airplane's failed to land, which resulted in a bounced, and the airplane nosed over, and the airplane impacted the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right-cinched the left wing, but the fuselage, and the airplane nosed over.   The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."

What did the pilot report on the accident no. CEN18CA021?,"Following a 1.5-hour local flight, the pilot was returning to his home airfield. Due to inbound traffic to the airport, the pilot circled once to the west and descended for the runway. About 8 miles from the runway, he lowered the landing gear and set 10° flaps. While on the base leg, the engine did not respond to the throttle inputs. The pilot switched fuel tanks, turned on the auxiliary fuel pump, and increased the mixture. Engine power was not restored, and the pilot notified the tower that the airplane had a total loss of engine power. Traffic was too heavy on a nearby road, so the pilot performed a forced landing to a vacant field. The airplane touched down, and the pilot applied brakes. The airplane traveled for about 90 ft, hit a ditch, and nosed over.   The pilot reported that he thought that he had about 45 gallons of fuel before takeoff, but he told the Federal Aviation Administration inspector that he had miscalculated his fuel. Only residue fuel was found during recovery of the airplane. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.","The pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane bounced landing, the airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and the runway.

Although the runway lights were illuminated at the time of the accident, the runway was not equipped with a precision approach path indicator (PAPI) or visual approach slope indicator (VASI) light system.  Examination of the airplane and the engine did not reveal any preaccident mechanical discrepancies that would have precluded normal operation. A review of the pilot's logbook revealed that the pilot had not flown at night in just over four months preceding the accident.  It is likely that, in the absence of a PAPI or VASI system by which to judge the airplane's approach path, the sparsely-lit terrain off the approach end of the runway may have created an illusion that resulted in the pilot's descent into terrain short of the runway.","The pilot reported that, during a tailwind, he applied with a nose-speed to restore. After the airplane touched down, the airplane sustained substantial damage to the runway. The pilot reported that, the airplane was came to rest inverted.

What did the pilot report on the accident no. WPR20LA157?,"The pilot was circling over a residence during a local flight. Witness video and flight tracking information indicated that, after completing a 360° turn, the airplane’s bank angle exceeded 40°. During the final turn, about 200 ft above ground level (agl), the airplane’s airspeed dropped below the published stall speed and the airplane stalled, entering a nose-low descent toward the ground. A sound spectrum analysis revealed that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident, and recorded engine data revealed no evidence of anomalies. Control continuity was confirmed.  The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot’s exceedance of the airplane’s critical angle of attack while maneuvering at low altitude, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and impact with terrain. ","The pilot reported that, during the landing roll in the airplane, the airplane ""sporm"" and the airplane's nose-attered aircraft flight, but the left wing tree. The airplane impacted a runway and then slid the airplane to the left wing and the airplane's engine. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and a field. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."

What did the pilot report on the accident no. ERA11CA061?,"According to the student pilot, he completed a stabilized approach to the runway, with the airspeed 5 knots higher than the prescribed approach speed due to the 8 knot headwind condition. During the landing flare, the airplane encountered a gust of wind, and bounced on the runway. He said he added power to slow the descent, but the airplane ballooned again with some drift to the left. He decided to execute a go around, and as he applied full power without adding rudder, the airplane veered to the left and departed the left side of the runway. He then reduced the power in an attempt to regain directional control of the airplane, but it continued forward until the nose gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest in a grassy area to the left of the runway. During the accident sequence, the airplane incurred substantial damage to the firewall and left wing. The student pilot reported there were no mechanical anomalies with the airplane. The wind reported at the airport about the time of the accident was from 150 degrees at 8 knots.","The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, he flew at a second-check pilot reported that, during the landing roll, the airplane bounced, he applied the airplane’s mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

What did the pilot report on the accident no. ERA19LA024?,"The airline transport pilot reported that he departed on a long, cross-country flight at night with full fuel tanks. The pilot stated that the fuel selector was set to the left main fuel tank on departure and that he moved the selector to the auxiliary tank about 1 hour later. About 1 to 2 hours after that, the pilot moved the fuel selector switch to the right main fuel tank, where it remained for the remainder of the flight (about 30 minutes). The flight was uneventful until it was on final approach to land and between about 400 and 500 ft above ground level, at which point, the engine suddenly stopped producing power. The pilot recalled the passenger saying there was no fuel pressure, and he immediately pushed the throttle and mixture full forward and retracted the flaps. He also turned on the auxiliary fuel pump and pressed the starter button to restart the engine to no avail. The pilot did not switch the fuel selector to another tank. Due to the low altitude, the pilot slowed the airplane and conducted an emergency landing in trees, during which both wings, the fuselage, and the tail section sustained substantial damage.   Postaccident examination of the engine and fuel system revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The fuel selector was found set to the right main fuel tank, which was found empty of fuel. However, measurable fuel was found in the remaining three tanks. Therefore, the loss of engine power was likely due to the pilot's mismanagement of the available fuel, which resulted in the loss of all engine power due to fuel starvation.","The pilot reported that, during a cross-country flight. He added that, during the landing gear and takeoff roll. The pilot reported that he had not activated, he applied the airplane landed the airplane bounced, the airplane nosed over. The pilot reported that, the airplane was the airplane sustained substantial damage to the runway, and the pilot reported that he was landed the airplane and the airplane.

"What was the Latitude, Longitude of the accident no. ERA17FA180?","36.926109,-87.608612The accident site was located in a wooded area near a house. Examination of the accident site revealed damage to trees and tree limbs consistent with a steep vertical descent. The descent angle between the tree contact height and the ground impact was about 53°. A ground scar associated with the left wing was oriented on a magnetic heading of 015°. Located inboard of the left-wing ground scar was a crater that contained components of the engine, airframe, landing gear, fuel tank bladder, and left wingtip with wing structure; immediately adjacent to the crater was the left elevator counterweight. Fuel blight was noted to the leaves of several trees immediately adjacent to the main wreckage. A 3.5-inch diameter tree trunk exhibited a smooth cut at a 45° angle consistent with being cut by a rotating propeller.The main wreckage consisting of the fuselage, section of wing, and empennage with attached flight control surfaces was located immediately adjacent to the crater. Outlying components of the airplane were found near the main wreckage. None of the components exhibited any evidence of fire. All components, including primary and secondary flight controls, necessary to sustain flight remained attached or were found near the main wreckage. Flight control cable continuity was confirmed for roll, pitch, and yaw except where cut for recovery or tension overload failure. Both elevator trim cables exhibited tension overload in the cockpit area, and both elevator trim tab actuators were symmetrically extended about 1 inch, which equated to 10° trailing edge tab up or airplane nose down. All flight control surface counterweights remained attached or were accounted for.Both wings were fragmented. Both flap actuators were extended about 2 inches, which equated to flaps retracted. The emergency locator transmitter was fragmented; the switch was in the off position; and the switch back was missing.Examination of the landing gear push rods at the landing gear gearbox indicated that the landing gear were retracted. Examination of the autopilot system components revealed impact damage, but there was no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.","33.65,-96.687344"

What did the pilot report on the accident no. CEN17LA285?,"A witness, who was a repair facility employee, stated that, on the morning of the accident, the airplane was fueled and then flown for about 15 to 20 minutes without incident. The accident flight was the second flight of the day and was also about 15 to 20 minutes long. The witness's cell phone video revealed that the airplane was on short final for the runway as it descended and turned left; it then disappeared into a wooded area. The airplane collided with a tree and then impacted the ground and came to rest upright. First responders to the accident site stated that the fuel lines had been severed, and fuel was covering the ground under the airplane.   The propeller blades did not exhibit signs of power during impact. Postaccident testing of the engine's distributors and fuel pump did not reveal any anomalies. However, postaccident testing of the injection carburetor revealed that the right float switch pin was dislodged from its cylinder, but it could not be determined when the pin became dislodged. The pin was reinstalled into its cylinder, and subsequent testing of the injection carburetor revealed that it was out of tolerance; however, the specialists at the repair station stated that, although several of the carburetor readings were out of tolerance, none of the indications would have caused a loss of engine power.   Postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The fuel selector was found positioned to the auxiliary fuel tank line, not the main fuel tank line. The valve was impact-separated from the airplane, and its preaccident position could not be confirmed. Based on the available evidence, the reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.","The pilot reported that, while the airplane touched down the runway and the runway and a ditch. The pilot reported that the airplane was conducting a site. The airplane nosed over, which resulted in a bounced landing, the airplane bounced, and the airplane had the airplane’s failure to the left. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, and the airplane landed on a go-around. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."

What did the pilot report on the accident no. CEN16LA274?,"Before the accident flight, the airplane's brakes were replaced with a custom brake system. Testing of the brake system after installation resulted in a failure of the right master cylinder. The cylinder was disassembled and the O-ring was found cut. The mechanic could not find any reason for the cut O-ring, so the O-rings on both master cylinders were replaced. The next brake test resulted in a brake fluid boil, and the brake builder informed the mechanic to change the type of hydraulic fluid. A subsequent ground brake test produced ""no issues or hesitation with the brakes at all,"" to include ""a full pressure pedal push to simulate a full locked brake to pressure test [the] system prior to taxi test."" A maintenance flight was then conducted, and, during landing, the airplane began to drift to the right. The commercial pilot applied the left brake; however, the brake failed and the pedal ""went to the floor."" The airplane departed the runway and collided with a wind sock structure. Postaccident examination revealed that the left brake master cylinder O-ring was cut; however, the reason for the cut could not be determined.  After the accident, the mechanic contacted the master cylinder manufacturer for guidance. The company replaced the master cylinders with an upgraded model. The new cylinders were installed on the airplane and the mechanic, with guidance from the custom brake manufacturer, conducted more testing. A second airplane flew with the newer brake system without issue.","The pilot reported that, during the landing roll, he was landing touch-and-go landing. The airplane was in the airplane for the airplane, the pilot was unable to maintain airspeed, and the airplane bounced. The airplane was unable to the left.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.  The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.  The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."
