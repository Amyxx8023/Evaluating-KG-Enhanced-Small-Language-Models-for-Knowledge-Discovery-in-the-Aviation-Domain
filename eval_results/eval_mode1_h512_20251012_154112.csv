What did the pilot report on the accident no. GAA16CA016?,"During a local flight, the pilot of the glider reported that he found a hole to climb above a cloud layer and rode mountain wave updrafts to 17,500 feet mean sea level (MSL). While cruising at 17,500 feet, the pilot observed multiple holes in the cloud layer below and could see the ""entire east behind me was still open."" About 20 to 25 minutes later, the pilot began hearing reports over the radio that ""precipitation was moving in"" and the ""cloud deck was thickening"" at the departure airport. The pilot decided to dive for the ""the last two remaining holes"" in the cloud layer, but during the descent his ""primary window"" closed and he continued south to the last remaining window. While flying in this window, the pilot reported that he was unable to maintain altitude and then was unable to maintain visual meteorological conditions due to the increasing cloud layers.   The pilot descended about 2,000 feet while in instrument meteorological conditions for about two minutes and did not see ""any sign of the cloud base."" About 6,400 feet MSL (2,200 feet above ground level), the pilot decided that his ""safest option"" remaining was to ""bailout."" Subsequently, the pilot placed his right hand on his parachute ""D ring"" and then ""jumped, arched, and pulled."" The parachute opened and the pilot landed safely in the tree canopy below, and the glider continued flying for a few miles and impacted trees. The canopy and left wing sustained substantial damage.  The pilot stated there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the glider that would have precluded normal operation.   About 5 hours before takeoff, a terminal aerodrome forecast issued for an airport about 12 nautical miles northwest of the glider's flight path, called for a ceiling of 3,500 feet overcast during the glider's flight. About the time of the accident, 18 nautical miles southeast of the glider's flight path an automated surface observing system reported a cloud layer of 4,900 feet few and 5,500 feet few.","The pilot reported that, while landing to the flight and the airplane was on the right and was about 400 ft above ground level, the airplane impacted the left wing. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."

What did the pilot report on the accident no. CEN15LA279?,"Shortly after takeoff, the pilot advised air traffic control that he was returning to the airport due to low oil pressure. The  engine subsequently lost power, and the pilot was forced to land in a wheat field 5 miles south of the airport. During on-site examination of the airplane, no oil was found in the crankcase, and subsequent examination of the engine and turbocharger revealed that the turbocharger was dry. Further examination of the engine revealed evidence of preignition in the No. 5 cylinder that appeared to have been caused by failed spark plugs. The top and sides of the piston head were eroded, which allowed the exhaust gases caused by the preignition to pressurize the crankcase and force engine oil out of the breather tube.","The pilot reported that he was uneventful the airplane in the airplane's left. He added that he was about 2,500 ft above ground level, the airplane was unable took the airplane and the right main landing gear-flight the airplane bounced.

What did the pilot report on the accident no. ERA17FA145?,"Although the airline transport pilot received preflight weather briefings that forecast a risk of severe thunderstorms along his route, he chose to depart on an instrument flight rules (IFR) cross-country flight in his motorglider. About 45 minutes after departure, he asked air traffic control for any pilot reports or other information about the line of weather, which was located to the north along his route. The controller advised that there were areas of heavy-to-extreme precipitation and offered to provide vectors through the area of least precipitation when the pilot arrived in the vicinity. The pilot acknowledged and advised the controller that he would divert to another airport south of the weather if the conditions deteriorated. The controller continued to provide vectors and inform the pilot of the location and severity of the precipitation as the airplane continued north. About 10 miles south of the line of weather, the controller issued a slight left turn to avoid an area of heavy to extreme precipitation. The pilot advised that he saw an area to his right that looked like a viable route, and after discussion with the controller, chose to navigate around the weather on his own. When the controller checked in with the pilot a few minutes later, the pilot said that his ride was smooth, and he could see some lightning to his right. He then indicated that he had entered the clouds and could no longer deviate around weather visually. No further transmissions were received from the pilot, and radar contact was lost about 2 minutes later.  The motorglider was highly fragmented at the accident site and was mostly confined to a small area about 75 ft in diameter. A large section of the left wing and the left flaperon were found in two separate locations about 4.5 and 3.5 miles away from the main wreckage, respectively, consistent with an in-flight breakup. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.  A review of available weather information revealed that the pilot likely encountered a severe rotating thunderstorm (supercell), with associated hazards such as severe wind shear, updrafts and downdrafts, hail, lightning, icing, and possible tornado activity.  The motorglider was not equipped for flight in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and the flight manual specifically prohibited flying according to instrument flight rules, in IMC, in heavy rainfall, or during thunderstorm activity. Despite the weather information provided to him before the flight, the pilot chose to depart toward and continue into the area of severe convective activity. The violent conditions associated with the supercell thunderstorm exceeded the motorglider's design stress limitations and resulted in an in-flight breakup.","The pilot reported that during the landing rolled flight, the airplane impacted a go-around. The airplane veered to the runway, the airplane bounced, and the pilot, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left.  The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

What did the pilot report on the accident no. CEN17LA179?,"The flight instructor stated that a preflight visual inspection of the airplane's fuel tanks indicated that the fuel in each tank was just above the tabs, which corresponded to 30 total gallons of fuel on board; he added that a pretakeoff engine run up revealed no anomalies. He and the student pilot then departed on the instructional flight and flew for about 30 minutes using fuel from the left fuel tank before switching to the right tank. The student reported that, when they switched fuel tanks, the left tank gauge indicated ""just above half"" full, and the right tank gauge indicated ""slightly higher"" than half full. Shortly thereafter, the student activated the carburetor heat and reduced engine power to idle to perform a simulated engine failure and forced landing; however, when the student applied the throttle at the conclusion of the simulation, engine power did not increase. The flight instructor performed a forced landing, during which the airplane impacted a tree.   Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the fuel selector was positioned to the left fuel tank, which was undamaged and contained no fuel. The right fuel tank contained about 14 gallons of fuel. The fuel lines from the engine firewall to the carburetor did not contain fuel. The fuel quantity transmitters were not tested, and their accuracy was not determined. No mechanical anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane, and the loss of engine power is consistent with fuel starvation.","The pilot reported that the airplane was on a rules touchdown and flying the ground level (ampa, but the airplane landed on the runway, the airplane was unable touchdown, and the right wing, and the airplane veered to the left.

He attempted to start the engine several times; however, it would not sustain power. The pilot performed a forced landing to desert terrain, during which the airplane impacted a small berm, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the fuel selector was positioned on the left fuel tank, which contained no fuel. The fuel quantity gauge indicated that the left fuel tank was empty, and the right fuel tank was about 1/4 full. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane and stated that if he had ""read the checklist,"" he might have been able to restart the engine. It is likely that the pilot's mismanagement of the fuel during the flight resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.","The pilot reported that, while landing in the airplane touched down and the airplane, the airplane was performed a low-rated the airplane touched down.

What did the pilot report on the accident no. ERA15LA249?,"According to the pilot, after receiving clearance to land, he completed the before landing checklist. He added that, during the touchdown, the landing gear collapsed. According to photographs provided by the airport authority, the airplane came to rest on its belly with the right main and nose landing gears collapsed and the left main landing gear partially extended.  Postaccident examination of the landing gear system revealed that the outer sidewall of each main landing gear tire exhibited scuff marks and that the main landing gear door was scraped. Further examination revealed that both of the main landing gear extension rods were bent at the assembly actuator and that the nose landing gear extension/retraction rod was fractured. This evidence is consistent with a landing attempt with the landing gear in transit rather than fully extended as reported by the pilot. No preimpact mechanical abnormalities were noted with the landing gear system that would have precluded normal operation.  The recorded weather at the time of the accident indicated that thunderstorms existed near the airport, and photographs taken shortly after the accident show thunderstorms at the airport. Therefore, it is possible that the pilot was distracted by the approaching thunderstorm, which led to his completing the before landing checklist too late during the approach for the landing gear to fully extend before landing.","The pilot reported that, during the landing roll in the airplane, he had the runway touched down and the airplane forced landing roll, the airplane and the left of the runway, he was subsequently density altitude.

As the airplane crossed the final approach fix, he reduced engine power and lowered the landing gear. He confirmed that he had three green landing gear indicator lights. Knowing the wind was from 220° at 16 gusting to 22 knots, he positioned the airplane to accommodate the crosswind. The airplane landed softly just left of the runway centerline about 85 knots and it started to slow during the landing roll. He gradually directed the airplane back to the centerline. However, the directional input did not correct the ground track, and he added left rudder. Suddenly, the nose of the airplane made a hard right 45° turn and the left side of the airplane skidded down the runway. He neutralized the rudder pedals, and the airplane exited the right side of the runway about 50 knots. The airplane traversed across the wet and muddy ground when the nose gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest nose down. The engine mounts sustained substantial damage.","The pilot reported that, during a normal runway, he had landing roll, the airplane departed the runway and the airplane bounced, and the airplane veered left.

What did the pilot report on the accident no. GAA16CA331?,"The flight instructor reported that he and his student pilot had remained in the traffic pattern, and had been practicing short field landings and power off 180 degree accuracy turns. The flight instructor further reported that he instructed his student to perform a short field landing for their sixth and final landing, and once ""they had the runway made"", he would take the flight controls. He intended to demonstrate how ""ground effect plays a part in our landings and how one can use it to their advantage if you were in a situation where one would be short on a power off 180 accuracy landing or in a real world situation"".  About 50 feet above the ground and over the runway threshold the flight instructor took the controls from the student pilot. He further reported that while he was talking to his student pilot about how ""ground effect can extend your landing distance if you carry extra airspeed"", he noticed that the pitch attitude was higher than normal and before he could add power or reduce the pitch attitude, the right wing ""gave way"" and impacted the ground, which resulted in substantial damage to the right aileron.  The pilot verified that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.   The Federal Aviation Administration has published the Airplane Flying Handbook FAA-H-8083-3A (2004). This handbook discusses stalls and states in part:  The key to stall awareness is the pilot's ability to visualize the wing's angle of attack in any particular circumstance, and thereby be able to estimate his/her margin of safety above stall. This is a learned skill that must be acquired early in flight training and carried through the pilot's entire flying career. The pilot must understand and appreciate factors such as airspeed, pitch attitude, load factor, relative wind, power setting, and aircraft configuration in order to develop a reasonably accurate mental picture of the wing's angle of attack at any particular time. It is essential to flight safety that a pilot takes into consideration this visualization of the wing's angle of attack prior to entering any flight maneuver.  Stall accidents usually result from an inadvertent stall at a low altitude in which a recovery was not accomplished prior to contact with the surface.","The pilot reported that during the landing roll in the right wing roll. He departed the airplane was on the landing roll, the airplane nosed over, and the airplane ""at"" that the airplane to the left. He was noted that the airplane’s fuel tank and nosed over.  The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."

During touchdown, the airplane’s right main landing gear axle broke, which pivoted the airplane to the right. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left side of the fuselage. In the pilot’s written statement to the NTSB, she reported that there were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane. She indicated that the surface wind on the glacier itself was light and variable, in contrast to the downdraft she encountered. She said that during subsequent approaches to the same site, she has altered her landing approaches to minimize the exposure to downdrafts, and increased the approach altitude, which would allow for a go-around if required.","The pilot reported that, during the landing rolled on the landing roll.

He attempted to turn the lights back on to no avail. He added that the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights were off and that he could not get the runway lights to turn on either. As he was landing past ""the first arrow in front [chevron in the displaced threshold],"" he heard a ""thump."" He taxied the airplane to the ramp without further incident.  The passenger, an airframe and powerplant mechanic, reported that, during approach after the cockpit lights went out, he used his flashlight to light up the cockpit. He was unable to correct the panel lights but observed that the runway lights were ""bright."" He added that, during the landing, he felt the ""bottom drop out"" and that the airplane landed hard and bounced.   Postaccident examination revealed that the right horizontal stabilator sustained substantial damage. The pilot added that he and the passenger went to the beginning of the approach runway and found pieces of broken runway lights.  Archived NOTAMs for the date of the accident stated that:     RWY 31 PAPI UNUSABLE","The pilot reported that, during a cross-country flight and landed the runway.

What did the pilot report on the accident no. WPR19FA115?,"The pilot began the takeoff roll in visual meteorological conditions. The airplane was airborne about 1,300 ft down the runway, which was about 75% of the normal ground roll distance for the airplane’s weight and the takeoff environment. About 2 seconds after rotation, the airplane rolled left. Three seconds later, the airplane had reached an altitude of about 80 ft above ground level and was in a 90° left bank. The nose then dropped as the airplane rolled inverted and struck the ground in a right-wing-low, nose-down attitude. The airplane was destroyed.  Postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe or engines that would have precluded normal operation. The landing gear, flap, and trim positions were appropriate for takeoff and flight control continuity was confirmed. The symmetry of damage between both propeller assemblies indicated that both engines were producing equal and high amounts of power at impact.  The autopsy revealed no natural disease was present that could pose a significant hazard to flight safety.  Review of surveillance video footage from before the accident revealed that the elevator was in the almost full nose-up (or trailing edge up) position during the taxi and the beginning of the takeoff roll. Surveillance footage also showed that the pilot did not perform a preflight inspection of the airplane or control check before the accident flight.  According to the pilot’s friend who was also in the hangar, as the accident pilot was pushing the airplane back into his hangar on the night before the accident, he manipulated and locked the elevator in the trailing edge up position to clear an obstacle in the hangar. However, no evidence of an installed elevator control lock was found in the cabin after the accident.   The loss of control during takeoff was likely due to the pilot’s use of an unapproved elevator control lock device. Despite video evidence of the elevator locked in the trailing edge up position before the accident, an examination revealed no evidence of an installed control lock in the cabin. Therefore, during the night before the accident, the pilot likely placed an unapproved object between the elevator balance weight and the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer to lock the elevator in the trailing edge up position.   The loss of control was also due to the pilot’s failure to correctly position the elevator before takeoff. The pilot’s friend at the hangar also reported that the pilot was running about one hour late; the night before, he was trying to troubleshoot an electrical issue in the airplane that caused a circuit breaker to keep tripping, which may have become a distraction to the pilot. The pilot had the opportunity to detect his error in not freeing the elevator both before boarding the airplane and again while in the airplane, either via a control check or detecting an anomalous aft position of the yoke. The pilot directed his attention to the arrival of a motorbike in the hangar alley shortly after he pulled the airplane out of the hangar, which likely distracted the pilot and further delayed his departure. He did not conduct a preflight inspection of the airplane or control check before the accident flight, due either to distraction or time pressure. ","The pilot reported that he was landing roll, he was the airplane on the runway, the airplane a suddenly during the landing roll, the airplane nosed over and the airplane landed in a hard, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.  The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."

What did the pilot report on the accident no. WPR19LA201?,"During a cross-country flight in night visual meteorological conditions, the airplane began to lose electrical power, and the pilot diverted to the nearest airport. During the landing approach, the pilot extended the landing gear and flaps, and, although the gear position indicator lights did not illuminate, he felt that the airplane was in its normal landing configuration and continued the approach. The right horizontal stabilizer and elevator contacted the runway upon landing, resulting in substantial damage.  Examination revealed that the nose landing gear was extended and locked, but the main landing gear did not extend and lock. A functional test of the landing gear and the emergency gear extension system revealed no anomalies. It is likely that electrical power remaining was inadequate to fully extend and lock the landing gear. The alternator was bench-tested and revealed no anomalies. Based on the available information, the reason for the loss of electrical power could not be determined.  ","The pilot reported that, during the landing rolled on the accident flight, the pilot reported that the airplane was landing gear and the airplane’s left wing and he performed a forced landing. The pilot reported that he was conducted a ""partin"" and the airplane bounced landing, but the airplane’s at the time, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation."

What did the pilot report on the accident no. CEN10IA397?,"According to the pilot, the helicopter was on final approach to a platform in the Gulf of Mexico when he raised the collective to perform a go-around. However, the helicopter did not respond properly; rather, its performance and torque indications remained fixed at 45 percent. The pilot began a slow climb and diverted to a land-based airport at a cruise speed of about 60 knots. Because of a complete loss of collective pitch control, the pilot made a running landing on the runway at the airport, touching down about 45 knots. The helicopter came to a stop in the grass about 100 feet past the end of the runway. An examination of the helicopter revealed that several fasteners were missing from the top clevis of the collective control tube, which led to the control tube becoming disconnected from the collective pitch arm on the swash plate. The missing fasteners were found loose on the deck in the transmission compartment. Records showed that maintenance to reinstall the transmission and main rotor hub had been completed about 6 flight hours before the incident and that several mechanics and two pilots had examined the helicopter before the incident flight without noting the improperly secured/missing fasteners.","The pilot reported that the airplane was saw the flight, the pilot and pilot-rated and pilot, the airplane began to land on the runway. He fuselage and the pilot, the airplane’s failure to maintain a low airplane landing, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left, and fuselage.
